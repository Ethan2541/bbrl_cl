# Subspaces Overview

## Outlook

This page is the main entry point to the BBRL Subspaces documentation. We expand the BBRL library with the notion of Subspaces of Policies. Behind this core concept, the goal is to improve an agent's performances over a wide range of problems despite only learning a few behaviours: the idea is that a new problem can be seen as a combination of well-known problems, to a certain extent. The main interest of such subspaces is that we get an infinite amount of policies while only storing a few ones.
